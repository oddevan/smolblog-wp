# Smolblog for WordPress

Smolblog is an idea. Smolblog is a state of mind. And yes, at least at first, it is a WordPress plugin.

Right now, this does nothing. [Follow along at oddEvan.com as I work on it.](https://www.oddevan.com/tag/smolblog/)

This repository is designed to replace the `wp-content` folder. To install (in basic terms):

1. Download and install WordPress however you want.
2. Delete the `wp-content` folder.
3. Clone this repo as `wp-content`.
4. Run `composer install` in this folder to get the other plugins and themes.

More detailed info coming soon.
